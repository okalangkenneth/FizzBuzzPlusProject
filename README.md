# FizzBuzzPlusProject

## Overview
The Modified FizzBuzz project extends the traditional FizzBuzz logic with additional rules. The program iterates from 1 to 100 and prints:
- "Fizz" for numbers that are multiples of 3 or contain the digit 3.
- "Buzz" for numbers that are multiples of 5 or contain the digit 5.
- A combination of "FizzBuzz" for numbers meeting both criteria above.
- The number itself if none of the criteria are met.

## Requirements
- .NET Core 3.1 or later
